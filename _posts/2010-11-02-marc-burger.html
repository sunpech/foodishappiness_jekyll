I finally got around to trying this place out after a friend kept recommending me the place. &nbsp;The burger was good, but not great. &nbsp;The ingredients were fresh, and the fries were delicious. &nbsp;But it wasn't a memorable burger to me, it was just the fries that kinda stood out. &nbsp;The only really negative thing I would have to say is that the cole slaw tasted quite bitter. &nbsp;As a side note, the spicy ketchup was tasty.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yXBgDl3EPrc/Tys81tJytrI/AAAAAAAA3tg/BdI6oMt5MZs/s1600/IMG_20101028_135434.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="241" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yXBgDl3EPrc/Tys81tJytrI/AAAAAAAA3tg/BdI6oMt5MZs/s320/IMG_20101028_135434.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ulAzSE5nO7A/Tys82sltOEI/AAAAAAAA3to/VMJJpHWUP8Q/s1600/IMG_20101028_140725.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="241" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ulAzSE5nO7A/Tys82sltOEI/AAAAAAAA3to/VMJJpHWUP8Q/s320/IMG_20101028_140725.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Marc Burger at&nbsp;Macy's Seven on State<br />111 N.
