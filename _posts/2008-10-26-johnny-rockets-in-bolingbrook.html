Went to <a href="http://www.johnnyrockets.com">Johnnie Rockets</a> today for an early dinner.  I ordered the Original, which has: Fresh lettuce, ripe tomato, chopped onions, relish, pickle, mustard and mayonnaise.  I also ordered an order of the half fries/onion rings.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />The balance between the meat and the condiments was imbalanced.  Too little meat, while a bit much on the mustard and relish.  But that is to be expected of a classic fast food joint.  Can't expect a gourmet burger from them.  That being said, the burger was fun to eat, and I would definitely recommend it over any MCD or Burger King hamburger, but maybe not over Wendy's.  I guess a pattern that may emerge from my present/future ratings is that I prefer my veggies to be served as larger slices/pieces, and not to be chopped up into little pieces.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score:</span> 6.5/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SQUFJOzhw5I/AAAAAAAAIOg/o2GjHMTc2RA/s1600-h/1225055404104.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SQUFJOzhw5I/AAAAAAAAIOg/o2GjHMTc2RA/s400/1225055404104.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261617395803472786" /></a><br /><br />Johnny Rockets<br />623 E. Boughton Road, Suite 105<br />Bolingbrook, IL 60440<br />630-783-9250<br /><br />As a small note, my friend Woody and I both agreed that the onion rings tasted like ass.
