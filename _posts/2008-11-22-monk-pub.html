I went to happy hour yesterday with some co-workers.  Our bar of choice was <a href="http://www.mmonks.com">Monk's Pub</a>.  I'm not sure how I heard of this place, I swore a co-worker told me about this place, but it doesn't seem so after I asked.  I apologize for the dark picture, my G1 phone doesn't have a flash on it, so a co-worker had to shine his cell's light to help light up the plate.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />It is a classic pub burger called the Monk Burger.  Lettuce, tomato, a pickle, and fries were all it came in.  I had mine done medium and it was just wonderful.  Of course I did add ketchup and mustard, but just a fair amount.  The patty was cooked perfectly at medium.  It was slightly on the greasy side, but the juiciness was just right.  Size, texture, and taste were all really good.  There's really not much I can complain about for this $8.45 set.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score:</span> 7/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SSjB6OHXKwI/AAAAAAAAIWg/BFsdZz0ZSxI/s1600-h/1227311258488.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SSjB6OHXKwI/AAAAAAAAIWg/BFsdZz0ZSxI/s400/1227311258488.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271676569802713858" /></a><br /><br />Monk's Pub<br />205 W Lake St<br />Chicago, IL 60606<br />(312) 357-6665
