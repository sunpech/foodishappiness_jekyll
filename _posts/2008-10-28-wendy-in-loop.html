<a href="http://www.wendys.com/">Wendy's</a> is probably one of my favorite joints to go grab a quick burger, fries, and a soda, let alone fast food in general.  So I had to do a quick review of it just to give you readers some idea of how I rate my burgers.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />I have to admit, I like my burgers with nice large slices of lettuce and tomatoes.  I do enjoy ketchup, and some mustard.  I like it balanced enough that it can be tasted in most bites, but won't ooze out on the side at the same time.  I believe Wendys delivers this kind of balance most of the time I visit.  <br /><br />The bun is a decent size, and it doesn't make the hamburger patty feel small and inadequate.  The real big minus is that the patties can be a little sloppy in it's cut and cook.  Never does it come out medium-rare, it always falls between medium to medium well.  And what I mean by cut is the patty is sometimes square, round, or some odd shape that doesn't match the bun.  But this is understandable.  It's not waaay better than fast food, it just <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> fast food.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score:</span> 6.5/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SQffgoClyVI/AAAAAAAAIPs/sCSV6zNIwlY/s1600-h/1225214402773.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SQffgoClyVI/AAAAAAAAIPs/sCSV6zNIwlY/s400/1225214402773.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5262420441202805074" /></a><br /><br />Wendy's<br />6 S Clark St<br />Chicago, IL 60603
