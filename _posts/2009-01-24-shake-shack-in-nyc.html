Thus far, all my posts have been about burger joints in the Chicagoland area.  Last weekend I was in New York City (NYC) visiting a friend.  I wanted to see the city a little and most importantly, eat some of the good food.  One of the places I visited was <a href="http://www.shakeshack.com">Shake Shack</a> in Madison Square Park.  It was a little cold out.  About 5F, so we did end up taking the food back to my friends place to eat, about a 7 minute cab ride.<br /><br />Can you believe they have a live camera feed from their joint on their website?  It's to show how big of a line there is.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />I did not have the Shack burger.  I wanted to get the double Shack burger, but was told there would be cheese all over and actually inside of it.  So I was only able to order a double hamburger.<br /><br />My burger was still really good.  Everything tasted really fresh and in all honesty, if I wasn't saving room in my stomach for steak from <a href="http://wolfgangssteakhouse.com">Wolfgang's</a> later on that night, I probably could have eaten two of them.  I do think the place is a little over-hyped, as I was expecting something completely phenomenal that would rock my socks off.  But I'm willing to concede that there were factors that worked against my review being completely fair.<ol><li>I didn't order their Shack burger (damn cheese...)</li><li>It was cold out</li><li>I didn't eat the burger right then and there (10 min cab ride back to friend's apartment)</li></ol>These factors possibly contributed to me not giving the burger a more fair and accurate scoring.  But nonetheless, it's still a pretty good score.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score:</span> 7.5/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SXuHR-1W87I/AAAAAAAAIgs/0x9bC6BckAg/s1600-h/1232309833345.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SXuHR-1W87I/AAAAAAAAIgs/0x9bC6BckAg/s400/1232309833345.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5294974529898476466" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SXuHSA5vmvI/AAAAAAAAIg0/dUxUmeGH3HI/s1600-h/1232309895444.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SXuHSA5vmvI/AAAAAAAAIg0/dUxUmeGH3HI/s400/1232309895444.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5294974530453740274" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SXuHSQoCicI/AAAAAAAAIg8/woEUMYXKSyk/s1600-h/1232311297908.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SXuHSQoCicI/AAAAAAAAIg8/woEUMYXKSyk/s400/1232311297908.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5294974534674450882" /></a><br /><br />SE Corner of Madison Square Park<br />Near Madison Ave and 23rd St.<br />212-889-6600
