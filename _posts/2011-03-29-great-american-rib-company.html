The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greatrib.com/">Great American Rib Company</a>&nbsp;has some pretty tasty tacos. I can't say that I was blown away by the ribs or chicken-- but the tacos were really good. I had the buffet there that night, and I just made sure to always load up on tacos each trip (only two). What's funny is that they had a printout of how to put together a taco-- I guess for the locals and non-expats.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LCi1E5rEIzQ/TWLXGwzz3yI/AAAAAAAAgDc/zhkPcWr0BAg/s1600/IMG_20101224_192347.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="301" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LCi1E5rEIzQ/TWLXGwzz3yI/AAAAAAAAgDc/zhkPcWr0BAg/s400/IMG_20101224_192347.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Sukhumvit 36 Road, Khlong Toei, Bangkok 10110, Thailand
