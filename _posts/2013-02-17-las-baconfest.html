Last week I went to <a href="http://www.labaconfest.com/">LA Baconfest</a>&nbsp;at the <a href="http://petersen.org/">Peterson Auto&nbsp;Museum</a>. I had a great time eating and taking pictures of everything bacon. I ate at almost every vendor... but alas the saltiness and cheese ingredients prevented me from eating absolutely everything.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this&nbsp;festival. One thing really stuck out: there were quite a few dessert booths. I'd <i>guessitmate</i> around a third of all the vendors were dessert-based. I thought I was going to see mostly very fatty bacon-y places with very big samples. But other than maybe <a href="https://slaters5050.com/">Slater's 50/50</a>, no one was serving anything huge.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6w9EYQWQkDg/USCFhuUywvI/AAAAAAABZR8/J3qL1GGlsgk/s1600/2013+LA+BaconFest+Collage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="456" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6w9EYQWQkDg/USCFhuUywvI/AAAAAAABZR8/J3qL1GGlsgk/s640/2013+LA+BaconFest+Collage.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />My favorite was the <i>smokey clam chowder</i> at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.umami.com/umamicatessen/">Umamicatessen</a>. The soup was just delicious!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IiDPEOQD-sI/UR969Jx12WI/AAAAAAABZIE/lmKcN32U61g/s1600/2013-02-09+at+15-43-16.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IiDPEOQD-sI/UR969Jx12WI/AAAAAAABZIE/lmKcN32U61g/s400/2013-02-09+at+15-43-16.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />My second favorite was the <i>bacon wrapped wing</i> from <a href="http://www.bigwangs.com/">Big Wang's</a>. I had this early on and I didn't think many places could come close to the simplicity of wrapping bacon around a chicken wing.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-coWJvId424c/UR94-DbKhzI/AAAAAAABY7E/lqoRr8SzPZc/s1600/2013-02-09+at+14-01-27.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-coWJvId424c/UR94-DbKhzI/AAAAAAABY7E/lqoRr8SzPZc/s400/2013-02-09+at+14-01-27.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Worthy mention was the <i>crack bacon</i> from <a href="http://www.grub-la.com/grub-lunch.html">Grub</a>. Straight up bacon on a stick. &nbsp;It tasted like a Thai bacon dish-- I can't remember the name right now.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--OaQvhorA-g/UR95YtFaabI/AAAAAAABY9s/YQw76i3DGWo/s1600/2013-02-09+at+14-16-18.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--OaQvhorA-g/UR95YtFaabI/AAAAAAABY9s/YQw76i3DGWo/s400/2013-02-09+at+14-16-18.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I love all of LA's food festivals. I look forward to checking out some more once the weather warms up! I did get asked what company I was taking pictures for with my DSLR with flash&nbsp;+ flash modifier. Had to tell the curious folks that I take photos for my own blog. I should really get a t-shirt made of my food blog to help promote it at food events!<br /><br />If you read my blog and see me at these food festivals, do say hi. I assure you I don't bite... unless you are made of food. Chow!<br /><br />Full album (165 photos) can be found <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/101693597219413173200/2013LABaconFest">here</a>.
