Went to <a href="http://www.paramountroom.com">Paramount Room</a> with some friends to watch the Bears/Packers game.  I've been here several times already and their food in general is pretty spectacular.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />I had their House Burger (Wagu Kobe Beef burger “dressed” with romaine, red onion, Beefsteak tomato and Paramount Room’s special sauce).  I added apple-wood smoked bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and a fried egg to it.  And I asked for it to be cooked medium.  The burger is simply awesome.  No complaints whatsoever.  <br /><br />The meat was delicious; the lettuce, tomatoes I ate on the side-- and which were very fresh and in proper amount.  The bacon was excellent with the egg (made me forget I was having dinner instead of breakfast!).  The mushroom I didn't taste so much since I already had a lot going on in this dish already.  Possibly the only drawback was that the bun was just okay.  It didn't add or take away from an already great dish.<br /><br />I also replaced the fries with Tempura Fried Green Beans, that came with a special Spicy lime-chili dipping sauce.  This was so ridiculously tasty and yummy, I also ordered it as an appetizer for the table.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score:</span> 8/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SVB28_HH-BI/AAAAAAAAIZQ/fKXTg-8lPl4/s1600-h/1229996689661.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SVB28_HH-BI/AAAAAAAAIZQ/fKXTg-8lPl4/s400/1229996689661.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5282853153011136530" /></a><br /><br />Paramount Room<br />415 North Milwaukee Avenue<br />Chicago, IL 60654
