Ben and I finally went out for some burgers after a very long hiatus. So we went to check out Busy Burger.  We enjoyed our burgers outside in the damp weather.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />The burger was just ok.  But what can you expect when the meal (burger & fries) cost like $5.65.  It meat was well done, lots of onions, and decent amount of ketchup and mustard.  It's a nice summer burger to enjoy if you are in the neighborhood (Little Italy), but not worth the time to go there if aren't in the area.<br /><br />Oh, the Italian ice (orange flavored) on the right is from <a href="http://www.eatmarios.com/">Mario's</a>, just 1 block east of Busy Burger.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score:</span> 6/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/Soovh2dJgMI/AAAAAAAALVk/NxZ96XxYxAI/s1600-h/2009-08-17+20.00.22.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/Soovh2dJgMI/AAAAAAAALVk/NxZ96XxYxAI/s400/2009-08-17+20.00.22.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5371157764192698562" /></a><br /><br />Busy Burger<br />1120 W Taylor St <br />Chicago, IL 60607-4214<br />(312) 226-7760<br /><br />Marios Italian Lemonade<br />1066 W.
