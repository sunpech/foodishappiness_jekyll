I always find it odd to go to a steak house and order a hamburger.  I should really order a cut of steak, but instead, I order a burger.  Haha, it just shows my dedication to this hamburger blog.  Yesterday, Ben and I headed out to <a href="http://www.selectcut.com">Select Cut</a>, this time it was Ben's pick.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />Their burger is a 1/2 lb Steak burger ($8.50) and can be found in their sandwich section on the menu (Yes, I had a hard  time finding their burger).  It was very tempting to order their New York steak sandwich instead, which was only $1 more.  It comes with a slice of tomato, 2 pieces of lettuce, a slice of onion, a pickle, and some delicious steak fries.  I ordered mine medium-rare (just because I know they would get it right, it is a steak house).<br /><br />My burger was very clean and tasty.  I can tell that the meal was prepared with health, balance, and a strong emphasis on the meat in mind.  I thoroughly enjoyed my burger, and I found out that it was just better to take a few bites of the burger consecutively before taking a bite of something else (pickle, fries, or water for example).  With each consecutive bite, the burger just tasted better and better .  Maybe I've been missing out on this experience my whole life as I generally like to take bites out of everything on my plate pretty evenly throughout my meal.<br /><br />There was only one thing I thought was missing: a little extra flavoring.  Maybe they could have added a little spice to it, or maybe something as simple as mayo would have been enough.  I just thought everything was so good; the meat, the buns, the condiments, but it felt as though it could have used one more ingredient to make it even better.  In many ways, I found this burger reminiscent of the burger I had at <a href="http://www.petemillers.com">Pete Miller's</a>, only that these guys had better beef.<br /><br />I apologize for the dark picture, as my camera phone does not have a flash.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score:</span> 7/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SWj7e6tDcQI/AAAAAAAAIbc/Wol4-lGyCHM/s1600-h/1231556898280.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SWj7e6tDcQI/AAAAAAAAIbc/Wol4-lGyCHM/s400/1231556898280.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289754270919520514" /></a><br /><br />2808 N.
