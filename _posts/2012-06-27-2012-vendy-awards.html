This past weekend I attended the <a href="http://streetvendor.org/la2012/">2012 Vendy Awards</a> in Los Angeles. The event was held at Pan Pacific Park specifically at 7600 Beverly Blvd.<br /><br />The Vendors:<br /><br /><a href="http://buttermilktruck.com/">Buttermilk Truck</a><br />One of the busiest trucks I think. The brick took a long time to make and there was almost always a constant line for that. I liked their food, but didn't think it was worth the long wait.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MNUTwINX9Xg/T-l3TRQJVUI/AAAAAAABOic/OEHqa376ofk/s1600/2012+Vendy+Awards1.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MNUTwINX9Xg/T-l3TRQJVUI/AAAAAAABOic/OEHqa376ofk/s640/2012+Vendy+Awards1.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.tacoselgallito.com/">Tacos El Gallito</a><br />The food here was just okay.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AmPj8_67Kwo/T-l3VMYhgKI/AAAAAAABOik/bA2YgNd4UGQ/s1600/2012+Vendy+Awards.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AmPj8_67Kwo/T-l3VMYhgKI/AAAAAAABOik/bA2YgNd4UGQ/s640/2012+Vendy+Awards.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/IndiaJonesCT">India Jones Chow Truck</a><br />Overall, I liked this food truck the most.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_4Jyf_GWJk/T-l3W7KONtI/AAAAAAABOis/x2t4h3Qb89k/s1600/2012+Vendy+Awards2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_4Jyf_GWJk/T-l3W7KONtI/AAAAAAABOis/x2t4h3Qb89k/s640/2012+Vendy+Awards2.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Martha's Tamales Organicos<br />I thought the tamales here were just okay, but I liked their jello-like dessert.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PX3vUKq-K4g/T-l3bQXpKqI/AAAAAAABOi8/szeFxnVSSps/s1600/2012+Vendy+Awards4.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PX3vUKq-K4g/T-l3bQXpKqI/AAAAAAABOi8/szeFxnVSSps/s640/2012+Vendy+Awards4.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://thelimetruck.com/">The Lime Truck</a><br />I really liked the Limeade here.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AMN2STfbcH0/T-l3Z0S1vhI/AAAAAAABOi0/TT60QdS_PYs/s1600/2012+Vendy+Awards3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AMN2STfbcH0/T-l3Z0S1vhI/AAAAAAABOi0/TT60QdS_PYs/s640/2012+Vendy+Awards3.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Karina's Food<br />All vegetarian ingredients here! Very well made, my other favorite at this event.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tf5wDWQo8Zo/T-l3dAHFgpI/AAAAAAABOjE/FawLbT5_Hl8/s1600/2012+Vendy+Awards5.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tf5wDWQo8Zo/T-l3dAHFgpI/AAAAAAABOjE/FawLbT5_Hl8/s640/2012+Vendy+Awards5.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br />Overall a good event. My sister and I had a quick discussion on how we didn't think the street vendors here represented the best that Los Angeles has to offer. We're really hoping to see <a href="http://www.lobstatruck.com/">Lobsta Truck </a>next year-- in fact we plan to nominate them! The music here was decent with some performers really outshining the others.<br /><br />The crowd here wasn't too big either, and it didn't seem as though it was as big as I thought it was going to be. I'd estimate around two-hundred to two-hundred fifty people may have showed up to the event, with nearly one-third of them being volunteers.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">I had fun and really liked how it wasn't too crowded and the wait in lines not being ridiculous.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br /><span style="background-color: white;">There were two awards given: the people's choice and the judge's picks.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">The people's choice went to Karina's Food, my second favorite street vendor at the event.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">The judges picked Inda Jones Chow Truck, which was my overall favorite and who I ultimately voted for. Congratulations to all.</span><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s_WJRClr_NE/T-l3f4qKRGI/AAAAAAABOjM/d3PRp8zrOuA/s1600/2012+Vendy+Awards6.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s_WJRClr_NE/T-l3f4qKRGI/AAAAAAABOjM/d3PRp8zrOuA/s640/2012+Vendy+Awards6.jpg" width="640" /></a>
