Tonight I had <a href="http://www.gooseisland.com/pubs/clybourn.asp">Goose Island</a>'s "classic burger", the Stilton Burger (without the stilton cheese-- yeah I know, but my stomach can't handle cheese so well these days).  I also had garlic fries and onion rings.  I should note that I ordered it from <a href="http://www.diningin.com">Diningin.com</a> as delivery.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />The burger, or I should say my meal, had a ridiculously strong flavor to it.  This burger had chunks of roasted garlic cloves on top of a patty that had cracked peppercorn, which was pushed between pumpernickel bread.  I really had a hard time finishing this burger because-- along with the garlic fries and onion rings, my senses and taste buds were on overdrive.  I asked for mine to be medium-rare, yet it came out medium well.  Can't anyone make my burger right?<br /><br />Honestly, my favorite part of the meal was the garlic fries, after brushing off the huge chunks of garlic flakes.<br /><br />Overall, the taste and presentation was a tad below average for me.  The pumpernickel bread was rather confusing in combination with such a strong flavored burger.  It just didn't make sense for me.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score: </span> 4/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SUCddR9e8bI/AAAAAAAAIYY/whLrCPBn0fQ/s1600-h/1228960190713.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SUCddR9e8bI/AAAAAAAAIYY/whLrCPBn0fQ/s400/1228960190713.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278391889641271730" /></a><br /><br />1800 North Clybourn in Chicago.<br />312.915.0071
