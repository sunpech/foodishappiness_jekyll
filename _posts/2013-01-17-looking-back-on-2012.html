So 2013 is here. Sorry, I had ten posts that spilled into this current year from 2012, but I did eat out quite a bit during the last two weeks of last year and I didn't want to miss out on sharing those pictures.<br /><br />Last year was a great year for me as a foodie. I ate variety of foods in different cities. Not as much as 2010 or 2011 since those were the years I traveled a lot (distance-wise), but living here in Los Angeles has exposed me to a larger variety of cultures than when I lived in Bangkok, Thailand.<br /><br />I took more pictures of food than any other year to date, although not all of them made it into the actual web albums. I actually had to split the pictures into separate albums since Picasa still has a stupid one-thousand picture limit per album. Stupid I tell you. I took over 1500 pictures of food in 2012!<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/101693597219413173200/2012FoodPorn">2012 Food Porn (volume 1)</a>&nbsp;- 967 photos!</li><li><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/101693597219413173200/2012FoodPornVolume2">2012 Food Porn (volume 2)</a>&nbsp;- 625 photos!</li></ul><div>I also grew as a food photographer more than any year.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In 2010 and 2011, I was by in large still using my camera phone to take pictures of food. I was also still using the on-camera flash too, which in general overexposes and drowns out the color of dishes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In 2012, I stepped up to using a Canon 60D and even upgraded to a Canon 5D Mark 3 full frame camera around mid year. You can say this was my first full year of using a DSLR for the majority of my food pictures! I shot mostly in RAW format and post processed in Adobe Lightroom 4. I tend to look back at my older pictures with some level of disgust at how awful the pictures are with noise or cropping.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, in 2012 I switched over to using a more square crop of my food pictures just because I find it to be more symmetrical and balanced for social sites such as <a href="http://www.foodspotting.com/">Foodspotting</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. It's default crop now for food photographs as it fills the frame much better and I find tells a better story if there's going to be a stack of photos from a restaurant.</div><div><br /></div>Here is a collage of some of my favorite shots and dishes from 2012:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RwBqdl1YyFk/UPYLjtOxgyI/AAAAAAABYQ0/6Pl_UTb_ods/s1600/Best+Pictures+of+2012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="425" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RwBqdl1YyFk/UPYLjtOxgyI/AAAAAAABYQ0/6Pl_UTb_ods/s640/Best+Pictures+of+2012.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />I look forward to 2013. I have a feeling I won't be taking as many photos, as I'm now aiming for better quality, not quantity.
