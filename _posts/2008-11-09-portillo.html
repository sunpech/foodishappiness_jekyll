Had <a href="http://www.portillos.com">Portillo's</a> for lunch today.  I've had their burgers many times before.  In general, I prefer their burgers to even that of Wendy's.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Review:</span><br />The bun size is excellent.  The patty was very good (it was cooked medium well which isn't how I like it, but then again I didn't specify how I wanted it done).  The lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles were all large and fresh just the way I like them.  Overall, the burger was very well put together.  My only complaint would be that I can always taste the burnt parts of the meat, thus it can never be juicy.  But I just think that is their style.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Score:</span> 7/10<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SRc9CFoTbRI/AAAAAAAAIVU/RnZirb6dyS4/s1600-h/1226252445133.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7U5MdumP-no/SRc9CFoTbRI/AAAAAAAAIVU/RnZirb6dyS4/s400/1226252445133.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5266745395313339666" /></a><br /><br />100 W Ontario St<br />Chicago, IL<br />(312) 587-8910
