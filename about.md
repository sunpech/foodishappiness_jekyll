I am a Thai-Chinese-American born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. I currently live in Los Angeles, California.</div>
<br />
I love eating food and really enjoy taking pictures of it to share with everyone. I consider myself a foodie as I enjoy eating wherever I am.&nbsp;Cooking isn't a skill I practice much, as I'm generally on the receiving end of where food gets produced. Often times I will be out eating, and almost always have my camera phone on me to take pictures of the meals I'm about to devour. Sometimes I will upload them to&nbsp;<a href="http://foodspotting.com/foodishappiness">Foodspotting</a>.<br />
<br />
The only foods I don't eat involve cheese, as I am lactose intolerant.  The only exception is pizza. I don't have super high tastes in food, as I  like to eat at more common places that aren't too expensive-- not that I  wouldn't want to try the finer foods. I really do enjoy my steaks,  burgers/fries, and the generally greasy foods. Chinese food is generally  a comfort food for me as that's what I ate when growing up.<br />

<span style="font-size: large;">About the Blog</span><br />
This food blog is picture-driven. I don't do in-depth reviews of the food, restaurant, or chefs. I just want to share my experience and thoughts of what I eat, in a casual manner. I rather the pictures tell the story.<br />
<br />
I started photographing the food I ate with my camera phone and progressed to using a DSLR. I try to present the food as it is served without doing much adjustments other than maybe removing the serving spoon. I will try to place it in as good of a light possible, and do something creative.<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy my blog.
