I've only visited NYC a few times already, so by no means am I an expert on the food and culture there. But I'd like to share what I've tried and what I look forward to trying in the future.<br />
<br />
<u><b><span style="font-size: large;">Pizza</span></b></u><br />
Just across the Brooklyn bridge is perhaps NYC's most favorite NYC pizza,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.grimaldis.com/">Grimaldi's</a>. I've visited this place just once so far, and thought it was just okay. I would like to try&nbsp;<a href="http://www.johnsbrickovenpizza.com/">John's of Bleecker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.firstpizza.com/">Lombardi's</a>&nbsp;for my visits in the future.<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Burgers</span></u></b><br />
Again, only one burger place in NYC:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shakeshack.com/">Shake Shack</a>. Pretty good and pretty fresh.<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Steakhouses</span></u></b><br />
I've only been to one steakhouse in NYC so far.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wolfgangssteakhouse.net/">Wolfgang's Steakhouse</a>&nbsp;provided me a fantastic experience and<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Chinese</span></u></b><br />
<a href="http://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/">Joe Shanghai's</a>&nbsp;has fantastic Shanghai soup dumplings aka, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongbao">xiao long bao</a>. But I would like to explore some places mentioned in the article:&nbsp;<a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2011/12/where-to-get-the-best-soup-dumplings-in-chinatown-nyc-new-york-xiao-long-bao.html">The Best Soup Dumplings In Chinatown, Manhattan</a>.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><b><u>Miscellaneous Places</u></b></span><br />
I really really really enjoyed the Korean fried chicken (KFC) at <a href="http://www.bonchon.com/">Bon Chon</a>, the one off 5th Ave. Hands down the best chicken wings I've ever had! The&nbsp;53rd and 6th Halal Cart is pretty awesome too, but just be careful of the red sauce, it's super hot!<br />
