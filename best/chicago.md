Chicago is my hometown, so I feel comfortable pointing out quite a few places to check out for good eats. Since I don't currently live in there anymore, this list may be slightly out of date.<br />
<br />
I left out chain restaurants that are located around the country. These are places that are specific to the city of Chicago. Enjoy.<br />

<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Pizza</span></u></b><br />
There's nothing quite like Chicago's deep dish pizza. For the longest time,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.loumalnatis.com/">Lou Malnati's</a>&nbsp;was my favorite. But after trying out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pequodspizza.com/">Pequod's</a>, I was converted. Another joint I recommend is Burt's Place.<br />
<br />
<b>Burt's Place</b><br />
8541 Ferris Ave<br />
(between Lincoln Ave &amp; Capulina Ave)<br />
Morton Grove, IL 60053<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Italian Beef</span></u></b><br />
There's really once place that I go to for my Italian beef fix:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alsbeef.com/">Al's Beef</a>. But I must confess, I have yet to try our Mr. Beef.<br />
<br />
<b>Mr. Beef</b><br />
666 N Orleans St<br />
(between Erie St &amp; Huron St)<br />
Chicago, IL 60610<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Burgers, Hot Dogs, and Wings</span></u></b><br />
For burgers,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kumascorner.com/">Kuma's Corner</a>&nbsp;is worth mentioning because it used to be my favorite place. But lately it's quality has gone down-- possibly due to it's massive popularity today.&nbsp;<a href="http://edzos.com/">Edzo's</a>&nbsp;is worth the journey up to Evanston to try.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thehophaus.com/">Hop Haus</a><br />
<br />
My favorite hot dog joint is&nbsp;<a href="http://hotdougs.com/">Hot Doug's</a>, despite the cult-like following and long lines.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.franksndawgs.com/">Franks N Dawgs</a>&nbsp;is fantastic too, and definitely under-rated as the lines aren't ridiculous-- yet. Another place worth a drive to, is Fat Johnnie's, for their tamale dogs! But it's all out-doors.<br />
<br />
<b>Fat Johnnie's</b><br />
7242 South Western Avenue<br />
Chicago, IL 60636<br />
<br />
For chicken wings,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buffalojoesevanston.com/">Buffalo Joe's</a>&nbsp;may be my favorite place. An easier place to go to Chicago-proper, is&nbsp;<a href="http://jakemelnicks.com/">Jake Melnick's</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crisponline.com/">Crisp</a>&nbsp;is great for Korean fried chicken (KFC) as well as Great Seas.<br />
<br />
<b>Great Seas</b><br />
3254 West Lawrence Avenue<br />
Chicago, IL 60625-5245<br />
<br />
<u><b><span style="font-size: large;">Steakhouses</span></b></u><br />
I consider Chicago steakhouses to be fantastic.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.davidburke.com/restaurant_primehouse.html">David Burke's Primehouse</a>&nbsp;is probably my favorite.&nbsp;<a href="http://kinziechophouse.com/">Kinzie Chophouse</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geneandgeorgetti.com/">Gene and Georgetti's Restaurant</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gibsonssteakhouse.com/">Gibson's</a>&nbsp;are also all great.<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Chinese</span></u></b><br />
Chicago is not a great place for Chinese food. But there are a few places that I really enjoy.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kenkee.com/">Ken Kee</a>&nbsp;is my favorite. For Shanghai soup dumplings, I recommend&nbsp;<a href="http://potstickerhouse.com/">Ed's Potsticker House</a>. Another Northern style is Lau Sze Chuan, which is becoming very popular.<br />

(between Wentworth Ave &amp; 21st St)<br />
Chicago, IL 60616<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Korean</span></u></b><br />
The Korean food in Chicago is nothing special either.&nbsp;<a href="http://chosunokrestaurant.com/">Cho Sun Ok Restaurant</a>, a tiny place for Korean BBQ. San Soo Gab San is the go-to for BBQ too, and is almost always open. <a href="http://delseoul.com/">Del Soul</a> is great too for Korean tacos. A great fusion place is <a href="http://bellyshack.com/">Belly Shack</a>.<br />
<br />

5247 N Western Ave<br />
(between Farragut Ave &amp; Berwyn Ave)<br />
Chicago, IL 60625<br />
<br />
<b><u><span style="font-size: large;">Thai</span></u></b><br />
There are a few really good Thai restaurants in Chicago.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stickyricethai.com/">Sticky Rice</a>&nbsp;is my parent's favorite for Northern style Thai. Siam House is my personal favorite. Aroy Thai is another favorite amongst Thai friends.<br />
<br />

<br />
<u><b><span style="font-size: large;">Miscellaneous places</span></b></u><br />
<br />
A great breakfast/brunch place is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sweetmaplecafe.com/">Sweet Maple Cafe</a>. Another great brunch place is&nbsp;<a href="http://longmanandeagle.com/">Longman and Eagle</a>, which is bar-like.<br />
